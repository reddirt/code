app-web issues

This is the same ESLint dependency conflict we encountered earlier! The issue is that eslint-config-airbnb@19.0.4 only supports ESLint v7-8, but you're using ESLint v9.35.0.
Let me help you fix this. You have a few options:
Option 1: Update eslint-config-airbnb to latest version (Recommended)
The latest version is still 19.0.4, which doesn't support ESLint v9. Let me check if there's a newer version that supports ESLint v9:
Based on the search results, eslint-config-airbnb@19.0.4 doesn't support ESLint v9 yet. Here are your options:
Option 1: Use --legacy-peer-deps (Quick Fix)
Option 2: Downgrade ESLint to v8 (More Compatible)
If you want to avoid using --legacy-peer-deps, you can downgrade ESLint to v8:
0
Option 3: Remove Airbnb Config (Cleanest)
Since you're already using MUI v7 and have a working setup, you could remove the Airbnb config entirely and use ESLint's recommended rules + TypeScript support (similar to what api-server uses).
Option 4: Wait for Airbnb to Support ESLint v9
The Airbnb team is working on ESLint v9 support, but it's not available yet.
What would you prefer to do?
Use --legacy-peer-deps (quick fix, works but bypasses dependency checks)
Downgrade ESLint to v8 (more compatible but loses ESLint v9 features)
Remove Airbnb config (cleanest, use ESLint recommended rules)
Something else?
Let me know which approach you'd like to take!
