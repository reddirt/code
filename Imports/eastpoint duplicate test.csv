We offer a diner-type menu made with fresh locally sourced ingredients, when possible, prepared by hand by local people.  Our goal is to give our customers the food they want...not the food we think they should want.

Dinger's Dive was born on May 1, 2022. After years of eating mediocre burgers and bland, overpriced meals, I decided it was time to shake things up.  So, I dropped everything and set out to build the fast food joint of my dreams. High-quality ingredients, delicious recipes, lots of TLC. Not to mention a super cool 80's retro interior design, great 80's music and super hip atmosphere.

Our goal at Dinger's Dive is to make the raddest meal you ever had. We know how to do this, too. With fresh, wholesome ingredients and lots of TLC.
Our menu features a wide variety of dishes to suit all tastes. From burgers to fish, poutines to gluten-free, we have something for everyone. We also offer daily specials!.
We offer takeout and free delivery in Montague and offer a dine in option next door at the Tailgate.

Open Tuesdays - Saturday

This beach is well known as a great source for discovering sea glass, clam digging and swimming. It also provides wonderful water vistas of the town of Souris and the harbor.  The small shops are highlighted by the Flavour Shack, owned by world-renowned chef Michael Smith. With additional shops offering local oysters, gifts, ice cream and more, this day park is a great place to spend the day. Showers and washroom facilities are also on site.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once you enter the town, you will be enamored with the 19th century buildings, many of which house local artisans, restaurants and the Visitor Information Centre. Artisans on Main is a non-profit organization run by thirty local artisans, who create, promote, and sell high-quality handmade products. Creations include products from jewelry, stained glass, visual arts, woodwork, and more. Whether it’s a gift, souvenir, or something for home or the cottage, stop in and say hello to a local artisan.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Souris’ Historic Lighthouse was built in 1880, and stands 14.3 meters above the cliff on Knight Point overlooking the town of Souris. You can discover the panoramic seascape and history of the Harbour and Town of Souris by climbing 45 steps to the lantern room and the outer platform. The Northumberland Strait, the Souris Harbour, and, on a clear day, the Cape Breton Highlands can be seen. Souris by the Sea Treasures gift shop is also located on the lighthouse property.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The heart of Souris is the waterfront where a thriving fishing industry invites visitors to participate. There are a number of fishing tours that are based in Souris, from the relaxation of fly fishing, the family experience of deep sea fishing with local captains that share their knowledge (and sometimes entertain with live music), up through the once-in-a-lifetime thrill and excitement of hooking a giant bluefin tuna.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Birdwatching is also a popular pastime for wildlife enthusiasts here in Souris. It is a common occurrence to spot blue heron, eagle or osprey. Attached is a </span><a href=""https://sourispei.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/field_checklist_of_pei_birds.pdf""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Field Checklist</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of the birds found on PEI for a great family activity!</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Without a doubt, one of the top attractions in the Souris area is Basin Head Provincial Park. Just east of Souris, Basin Head was named the top beach in Canada in 2013 by Vacay.ca. The park features a Fisheries Museum, a play area, concessions, a washroom and shower facility and, last but not least, a supervised, miles-long white sandy beach. Kids and adults alike line up to jump into the deep water off the bridge that connects both sides of the beach, gliding with the current while it gently sweeps you away up to the sandy beach.  It is one of those rare spots where locals and visitors gather together and has been an essential part of the community for many years. Anyone who grew up or visited the beach in their younger years will have these visits ingrained in their memory. With sand called “singing sands” due to the squeaking sound you hear when you walk on it, Basin Head beach is a spectacular beach with much fun to offer.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From the historic lighthouse that looks over the town, through our beaches, activities, parks, and festivals, Souris is a town that will draw you in and welcome you. The memories you make here will last a lifetime!</span>
