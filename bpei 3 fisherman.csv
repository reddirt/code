,,,,,,,,Basin Head | Points East Coastal Drive Lookout,,"<p>Ice Cream Lovers Rejoice!</p>
<p>An important ingredient in the popular dessert can be found right here at Basin Head.</p>
<p>The Marine Protected Area is Prince Edward Island&#8217;s only natural habitat for Chondrus Crispus, a giant variety of Irish moss rich in carrageen, and used in many household products such as ice cream and sunscreen. The local wildlife group consistently monitors the growth of the moss, undergoing restoration activities as needed. Water from several sites is sampled for nutrient analysis, streamflow measurement, and water chemistry. Clumps of the Irish moss and PEI Blue Mussels have been planted at select locations and are surveyed and documented to restore the Irish moss population at Basin Head to healthy, self-sustaining levels.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Canada&#8217;s 150th anniversary is something to be proud of! To commemorate the occasion, what better way than one of the largest collaborative art pieces in the nation! With over 1000 people having input into the design of the mosaic, this mosaic truly represents Canada&#8217;s beauty. The design team took all written suggestions and put this together on a mock-up of this piece, which is 42” by 15’, now installed at the Cavendish Farms Wellness centre. The mosaic was painted by over 200 citizens of the community; the majority of who have no previous painting experience. An initiative of the former Town of Montague, and facilitated by David Trimble, this piece took just over three months to complete and was appropriately named “Impressions of Canada”.  </span></p>
